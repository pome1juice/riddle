Riddle Game
The online program is a light weight guessing game. Users enter a username and can start the game immediately.
The game is easy to play and keeps track of the users' scores. The game is available to many users.

UX
The interface is simplistic. The user enters the name and guesses by typing into an input text. There is very littl
to go wrong using this approach.

Features
There is a welcome page which prompts the user to enter a username. If the username exists then the player can
carry on where he or she left off. Else the system creates a new user with score 0.

After creating a user, the game commences at the user page. We first display the username and score, and an image.
The user needs to guess the name of the company represented by this image. 

The user needs to submit the answer. On successful submission the user's score will increment by one and he will be
presented with a different question. Given a wrong answer, the user is prompted to try again.
